# Tower-of-Hanoi-iterative-solution
Overview

This project implements an iterative (non-recursive) solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem in C.

Instead of using recursion, the program:

Simulates the three pegs using arrays

Calculates the total number of moves using 
2
𝑛
−
1
2
n
−1

Uses the ruler pattern to determine which disk moves at each step

This approach demonstrates how recursion can be replaced with iteration and mathematical patterns.

🎯 Features

✅ Fully iterative solution

✅ No recursion used

✅ Uses ruler pattern to identify disk numbers

✅ Handles odd and even number of disks correctly

✅ Displays every move step-by-step

🧠 Key Concepts Used
1. Tower of Hanoi Rules

Only one disk can be moved at a time

A larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk

Goal: move all disks from Peg A → Peg C

2. Ruler Pattern (Disk Identification)

The ruler pattern is:

1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 ...


In this program:

The disk number moved at step i is calculated by:

Counting how many times i is divisible by 2

Adding 1 to that count

Example
Move Number	Disk Moved
1	1
2	2
3	1
4	3
5	1

This logic replaces recursive depth tracking.

3. Iterative Move Strategy

Odd moves → Always move the smallest disk

Even moves → Make the only legal move that does not involve the smallest disk

The direction of movement depends on whether n is odd or even

🗂️ Data Structures
int pegA[10], pegB[10], pegC[10];
int topA, topB, topC;


Each peg is implemented as a stack

topX = -1 means the peg is empty

Disks are represented by integers (1 = smallest disk)

🧮 Total Moves Calculation

The total number of moves is calculated iteratively:

2^n - 1


This avoids using the pow() function.

▶️ How to Compile and Run
Compile
gcc hanoi.c -o hanoi

Run
./hanoi

🖥️ Sample Input
Enter the number of disks: 3

📤 Sample Output
Move disk 1 from A to C
Move disk 2 from A to B
Move disk 1 from C to B
Move disk 3 from A to C
Move disk 1 from B to A
Move disk 2 from B to C
Move disk 1 from A to C

Total moves: 7
